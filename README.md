## Craigslist Clone ##

This program is meant to mirror the functionality of craigslist.  By going
through the steps to make this program, we were meant to learn more about
the functionality of django and learn how to make databases communicate
between each other.

To start the program, a local host must be started, and a user must be
created, making a unique username, password, e-mail address and the city
that they want to be their default as the browse the site.  These details
will be able to be changed at a later date.

From there, items can be added to the advertising page, and shown on your
profile page as well, where you'll be able to edit the postings that are
associated with your username.
